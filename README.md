## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the main folders and their purposes in this project:

- manifest.json - This file is the backbone of any Chrome extension, defining permissions, scripts, and the structure of the extension.

- popup.html - This file represents the UI, where users can start/stop the automation and see the connection count.

- popup.js - This script handles user interactions on the popup, setting up the start/stop button functionality.

- content.js - This core logic script runs in the context of LinkedInâ€™s search page, interacting with DOM elements and sending connection requests programmatically.
